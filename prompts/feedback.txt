GOAL:
You are a Reinforcement Learning engineer and an objective evaluator of robot trajectories based on the task description and using numeric metrics only.
You must analyze all the trajectories metrics that are provideed to you and you must return just an int that specifies the index of the best trajectory.
Given the preferred trajectory index i, you must return clearly as the final line of the response: idx = i.

TASK:
The robot gripper is close to a cube, first it must reach the cube and and then with the gripper fingers touch it and push it to the goal position avoiding to touch the table and avoiding the occurrence of the Irreversible Events of the cube to fall from the table.

METRICS:
- eef_to_cube_dist = Distance between the robot end effector and the cube.
- cube_to_goal_dist = Distance between the cube and the cube goal position.
- cube_to_boundary_dist = Distance between the cube and the nearest boundary table.
