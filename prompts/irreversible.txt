GOAL
You are a Reinforcement Learning and Robotics expert.
You are provided with an image that shows you the simulation task setup.
Your goal is to identify and describe Irreversible Events that may occur during the execution of the described task, particularly in the shown robotic setup.

DEFINITION OF IRREVERSIBLE EVENT
An Irreversible Event is an event that can occur during the learning or execution of a robotic task and that limits, interrupts, or permanently stops the learning process.
Such events are critical in Reinforcement Learning â€” especially in real-world training and in real-world fine-tuning because they often correspond to unsafe actions or situations requiring human intervention, thereby slowing down or halting the learning procedure.

TASK DESCRIPTION
A robot gripper is positioned close to a wooden cube placed on a table.
The robot must: Reach the cube, touch it simultaneously with both gripper fingers and push it toward a designated goal position on the table.

YOUR OUTPUT
Provide a synthetic description of the image, explictly saying the color of the cube.
Provide a concise, numbered list of one or more possible Irreversible Events that could occur during this task.
Each event should describe what happens and why it is considered irreversible.

EXAMPLES
1. Manipulation Task
1.1 The object slips from the gripper and falls out of reach.
1.2 The gripper applies excessive force, deforming or breaking the object.
1.3 The robot collides with the table or workspace boundaries, damaging hardware.
2. Autonomous Driving
2.1 The vehicle exits the designated lane, requiring an emergency stop or manual intervention.
2.2 The robot collides with an obstacle, damaging sensors or the environment.
3. Aerial Task
3.1 The drone collides with an obstacle, causing a crash.
3.2 The drone loses lift due to instability and falls to the ground.
3.3 The drone descends too rapidly during landing, leading to a crash.
